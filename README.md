# Stock Price Comparison: Tata Motors and Tata Steel

This project aims to compare the stock prices of Tata Motors and Tata Steel using Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. The project involves data extraction, processing, and visualization of the stock price data for the two companies. The code is written in a Python notebook (`.ipynb` extension) and hosted on Google Colab.
